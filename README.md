# Liquid-Crystal-Imaging-Software

THe Liquid Crystal imaging software is a software developed at ESI Inc., Cincinnati, OH for the purpose of generating contours of Shear stress, skin friction, etc. from an image of LC applied to surfaces with shear. The software capabilites to generate HUE vs SHEAR profiles for different liquid crystal materials and storing these characterstics in a database and retrieveing them at the time of contour generation are also being implemented. 

The software is written in Python 3 with various modules like Numpy, Scipy, OpenCV, PIL, Matplotlib, etc.

The front end of the software (UI) is generated using PyQT5 designer tool and integrated with the backend.
